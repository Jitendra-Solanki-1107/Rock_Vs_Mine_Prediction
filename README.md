# Rock vs Mine Prediction
There is war is going on between two countries submarine of the country is going under the water to another country and enemy country planted some mines in the oceans mine are nothing but explosive that explodes when some object comes in contact with it and there can be rocks in the ocean so submarine needs to predict whether it is crossing mine or rock our job is to make a system that can predict whether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock so how this is done is submarine uses sonar signal that sends sound and receives switchbacks so this signal in the processed to detect whether the object is a mine or it's just a rock in the ocean to predict the rock and mine we use algorithm Logistic Regression


## Four Steps involved in the model

01. Begin by collecting SONAR data and understanding the content of the dataset
02. Preprocess data
03. Train - Test data
04. Feed a logistic regression model after determining data subset to be satisfactory


## Based on above model we can predict whether a object is Rock or Mine
